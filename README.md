Logo Design for BitCan (DIY Bitcoin Seed Storage)

https://bitcan.world/

BitCan provides a cost-effective, DIY solution for securing Bitcoin mnemonic seed phrases â€” striking a balance between fragile paper wallets and heavy-duty metal plates.

Each binary-encoded glyph corresponds to a word from the seed list, allowing for discreet etching onto common materials.

The design ensures that the medium isn't easily deciphered by unintended observers, such as cleaning staff or intruders.
